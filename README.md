# Nawah Sandbox

Nawah Sandbox is a web app designed to provide an interactive environment to interact with your [Nawah](https://github.com/nawah-io/nawah_docs) apps. You can use it to test some calls, or update some records, or as interactive shell for your app for any element of your app that is accessible via the endpoints you created in it.

You can start using it now by visiting the built from this source version at: [https://nawah-io.github.io/nawah_sandbox/](https://nawah-io.github.io/nawah_sandbox/).

Note that, by using the Github-Pages-deployed version of Nawah Sandbox, you are using it over secure connection, meaning that you will only use it to connect to `localhost`, and secure websockets (`wss` protocol). If you are planning to use Github-Pages-deployed version to connect to non-secure (`ws` protocol) then you will need to clone this repo on your own and build it locally.
