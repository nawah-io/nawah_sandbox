# Nawah Sandbox

Nawah Sandbox is a web app designed to provide an interactive environment to interact with your [Nawah](https://github.com/nawah-io/nawah_docs) apps. You can use it to test some calls, or update some records, or as interactive shell for your app for any element of your app that is accessible via the endpoints you created in it.

You can start using it now by visiting the built from this source version at: [https://nawah-io.github.io/nawah_sandbox/dist/nawah-sandbox](https://nawah-io.github.io/nawah_sandbox/dist/nawah-sandbox).
